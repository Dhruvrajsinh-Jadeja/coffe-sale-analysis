Situation : 

A coffe shop want ot identify that why their sales are descreasing over time . Also want to give discount to some people but don't  know whose to give their invest much money but not get as much result or profit out of that so they want to know what is the reason behind this.

Task : 

First of all , load the data in excel delete null or missing values so i get the less error result then move to power query editor analyze data add column profit by multiply quantiy and price then transform the data so it can be easy to interpret . cload & load data to excel sheet , analyze data and from them create KPIs like Avg.Bill / person , Avg.oeder/person , total Bill etc create Pivot table and at the end create interactive dashboard which saws insight 

Analysis ;

i have analyzed that ,
- 8am-10am is peak over of product sale
- analyze top selling coffe
- Most oedered size is regular
- hell's kithchen has most footfall
- on the friday order is more compare to other days

Recommendation :

- as the day move to end sales exponentialy decrease so at that the they cut the staff member or i can say 8am to 10 pm which is peak hours they should increase staff so that shop get the maximum profit out of that
- Coffe shop owner should give 5 to 10 % discount person whos order cross the 4 so the customer visit more
- large sized product is sold only 9 % so that they should not much invest in that product
- Barista espresson is most sold product with profit of $91496.20 so shop should increase the making of that product and brewed black tea less
- hell's kithchen foot fall cross 50k
- Friday sale ($21701) is highest compare to different weekdays as weekend is coming so that they should increase staff on that they because more people will come their coffe shop also provide some inteactive offer that will more attract peoples.
